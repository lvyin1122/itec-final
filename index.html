          <p>Anxiety is a subjective feeling of unhappiness, uneasiness and discomfort. It is an emotion characterized
            by an unpleasant state of inner confusion. And it is usually a kind of generalized, unfocused and
            overreaction to a certain situation.
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes, people feel mental anxiety, while some people's anxiety will be accompanied by a certain degree
            of physical discomfort. According to KY survey results(2019), the more serious the anxiety, the higher the
            level of physical discomfort is, and there is a positive correlation between them.</p>

                  <p>Previous research have confirmed that anxiety sensitivity, as well as some physiological factors
                    related to anxiety,
                    are genetically related. And the heritability of these anxiety related factors in women is greater
                    than that in men.</p>
                    <p> Women are more likely to cause anxiety due to their higher degree of neuroticism than men, such as
                    sexual assault.The shaping process of gender roles makes women more sensitive to social rules and norms.
                    However, the stereotype of men in society will also lead to more pressure on men in career and
                    anxiety.

                  <p>Age can affect people's anxiety levels. The older the people, the lower their anxiety level. This
                    may be due to the fact that with the increase of age, people's life is more regular than when they
                    were young, and the frequency of adverse life events is reduced; at the same time, career
                    development reduces the economic pressure; while people enter a later stage of life, to some extent,
                    it also reduces the negative emotions caused by parents' marriage problems (Henderson, jorm ,
                    Korten,Jacomb, Christensen & Rodgers，1998）。</p>

                  <p>Higher the frequency of exercise, the higher the frequency of social interaction, less the time of
                    using the Internet will lead to lower anxiety levels. Among the people who exercise every day, only
                    20.96% of them have a high level of objective anxiety, while among the people who never exercise,
                    this proportion is almost twice that of the former, accounting for 39.56%; similarly, among the
                    people who have social activities every day, 23.59% have a high level of objective anxiety, while
                    39.11% of the people who never participate in social activities have a high level of anxiety.

              <div id="exampleAccordion1" class="collapse show" role="tabpanel">
                <p>About the cause of anxiety, nearly a quarter (24.7 percent) of people are anxious because their
                  academic or career performance cannot meet expectations, while 16.78 percent people’s stress is the
                  result of unsatisfactory intimate relationship or not having it at all. Another 15.77 percent people’s
                  stress comes from economic pressures.
                </p>
                <p>To summarize, anxiety could be avoided only if people achieve personal accomplishments, receive love
                  and wealth simultaneously.

                <p>Gender makes little difference regarding the major causes of anxiety, but marriage status does.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unmarried people are mostly worried about themselves, and academic / career development bothers more
                  than a quarter of single people. However, people with marriage experience (married, divorced or
                  widowed) tend to concentrate more on problems related to their children though they might also concern
                  about their career. Nearly a tenth of them are constantly worried about their inability to raise and
                  educate their children well.</p>

              <div id="exampleAccordion3" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
                <p>Uncertainty is considered to be the major source of anxiety. The more and more widespread anxiety of
                  modern people is not only related to the degree of uncertainty that each of us can feel, but also
                  related to individual's tolerance of uncertainty. The tolerance for uncertainty measures the extent to
                  which people need and look for predictability and how they react in uncertain situations (Eysenck,
                  derakshan, Santos & Calvo, 2007).</p>
                <p>Researchers have invited interviewees to judge five statements, such as "unexpected things will make
                  me very depressed", "even the smallest doubt will stop me from doing something", and measured
                  everyone's tolerance for uncertainty accordingly; interviewees also rated the level of uncertainty
                  they felt (from a scale of 1-10 points). The results of the data show that the lower people's
                  tolerance for uncertainty, the more uncertainty they feel about life, followed by a higher anxiety
                  level.</p>

                roots from personal psychology, but also arises from the impact of structural changes in the society as
                a whole. In the past three decades, China's social structure has changed dramatically, and individual’s
                mobility has increased. Many individuals left their original groups and families to enter new cities. In
                this process, most people have experienced a certain degree of "individualization" and “fragmentation”.
                The experience across generations has become somewhat useless, and social connections have been reduced (Twenge, 2000).</h6>

                information technology makes it easier for information dispersion, so people can easily obtain other
                people's living standards. For example, we can learn from WeChat that our childhood mates in the United
                States have realized financial freedom - making us more susceptible to anxiety from relative
                deprivation. In this survey, nearly one-third of the respondents think that "peer pressure intensifies

                responsible for the larger family. Compared to their parents, young people have a longer education
                period, a longer time before reaching adulthood, and a five-year delay to choose their career and build
                their family. Although most of us think that the traditional mentality needs replacement, the

          <p align="left">
            According to our survey, more than half of the respondents (53.57%) 
            confirmed that anxiety has a positive effect. In fact, an appropriate 
            level of anxiety can indeed help people objectively understand their 
            situation. In this survey, 27.31%, 22.31%, and 18.24% of the respondents 
            believe that anxiety can “provide an opportunity to reflect on life, help 
            to better understand themselves”, “strengthen the motivation to study / work”, 
            and “enhance attention towards life risk". 
          </p>

          <p align="left">
            On the other hand, anxiety can really affect the performance 
            of tasks that require more concentration or short-term memory (Eysenck & Calvo, 1992). 
            In the survey, respondents considered that the three most important negative 
            effects caused by anxiety were “declining attention, poor learning / work 
            efficiency”, “avoiding social interaction”, “declining appetite or poor sleep”, 
            accounting for 23.84% of all responses, 20.27%, 16.86%.
          </p>

          <p align="left">
            The impact of anxiety varies. However, 83.07% of the respondents 
            said that they have tried to actively improve their anxiety. We have also collected 
            some opinions and methods on how to coexist with anxiety: 26.09% and 47.36% 
            respectively I think that finding a suitable lifestyle can help or relieve 
            anxiety greatly, and learning meditation / participating in regular exercise 
            and finding good friends to communicate can also help reduce anxiety.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p align="left">
            More than half of the respondents think that addicting to games / Internet 
            is the most ineffective way. 31.24% and 28.33% of people believe that eating 
            help is very small or relatively small, and even seemingly positive behaviors 
            such as hard work is essentially avoiding anxiety, may have "miracle effects" 
            in the short term, but aggravate anxiety in the long term.

                  <h3> 1. Focus on things that controllable.</h3>

                    <p>
                        Since anxiety is largely a result of people's uncertain feelings, 
                        you can try to turn expectations into plans. When facing big challenges, 
                        instead of worrying about possible failures and restless, try to write 
                        down the reasons why they may cause failures, and find out if there is 
                        a way to avoid these failures. If there is really a risk that you can't 
                        do, then you can plan how to deal with this risk.<br/><br/>

                        At the same time, try to start with the things you can control, dismantle 
                        the goal, and gradually find a sense of mastery. For example, the long-term 
                        goal is to complete a doctoral dissertation. The small task that can be 
                        refined to every day is to write 500 words in half a day. Sometimes you can 
                        also give yourself some small rewards, such as completing 5000 words to reward 
                        yourself for buying a small jewelry.<br/><br/>

                        Many people's anxiety is widespread, and it is easy to think negatively 
                        about things, and that can be consciously trained to change cognitive 
                        biases. Some psychologists will advise people to pay attention to and 
                        record the five pleasant things they encounter every day, hoping to gradually 
                        shift their attention to the positive aspects of things.

                  <h3> 2. Observe anxiety and embody your feelings</h3>
                    <p>Some people may be trapped by the anxiety itself, so what you have to do is:<br/><br/>

                      Become an observer of your own feelings, because there may be deeper emotions 
                      behind some anxiety, and anxiety is only a means of defense for people. If many 
                      ways to relieve anxiety are not working for you, identifying the true source 
                      behind them is key.<br/><br/>

                      For example, when you worry about "I will be lonely", you may be thinking, "
                      I eat too much, my habits are bad, and no one will like me." When you capture 
                      and observe your feelings, you may find that it is not that uncertain future 
                      that bothers you, but "I want to escape these negative feelings."<br/><br/>

                      You can also try to label idea categories instead of focusing on the content 
                      of the idea. When you notice that you are worried (such as when you start 
                      worrying that you will fail or experience a loss), label it "I'm worried". 
                      If you start criticizing yourself, label it "criticism." This process can help 
                      you get rid of the content of the idea, avoid being trapped by the content, 
                      and make you more aware of the process of "what am I doing" and "why do I have 
                      these ideas", so that you may be able to realize, There are other more objective 
                      and peaceful ways to look at the situation now.<br/><br/>

                      Don't be afraid of anxiety itself. Believe that you can talk to, live with, 
                      and even overcome or take advantage of this emotion.

                  <h3> 3. Learn to relax, do not escape </h3>

                    <p>
                        You can choose to meditate, exercise, chat with friends, or even 
                        do things that are not related to your current goals, such as doing 
                        laundry. These things can help you increase your sense of control 
                        and keep you from getting stuck in anxiety. Many interviewees 
                        mentioned in their stories that meditation and exercise really 
                        help them get rid of their anxiety and focus more on the tasks 
                        that should be done now. You can choose some meditation tools, 
                        improve your concentration, or improve your sleep quality, which 
                        can help improve your ability to control your emotions.<br/><br/>

                        It can be seen from the survey that our perception of our anxiety 
                        is sometimes not so accurate. Looking at the sharing in the circle 
                        of friends and listening to others constantly talking about anxiety, 
                        we unconsciously exaggerated the anxiety that was normalized. It is 
                        true that anxiety often comes from uncertainty, but the uncertainty 
                        of life is a normal state of life and it also means more possibilities.<br/><br/>

                        I hope we can all accept the changes and ambiguities in life with a 
                        calmer attitude. Don't be afraid, walk in with a more positive attitude, 
                        and try to use your own strength to explore your own path out of this mist.<br/><br/>

                        If you are worried that you will feel powerless in the face of this 
                        anxious era, then look for more interpersonal connections, talk with 
                        friends about your true thoughts, and try to talk to your family about 
                        your current situation and feelings.<br/><br/>

                        Anxiety is often not the problem itself. It is more like a signpost, 
                        trying to understand the source of anxiety, maybe it can reveal some 
                        of our own secrets and potentials to us. In an age of constant talk 
                        about anxiety and selling anxiety, you may wish to be a person who 
                        accepts and understands anxiety.
